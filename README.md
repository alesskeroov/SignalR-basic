# SignalR Basic Example

This is a basic ASP.NET Core project where I explored how **SignalR** works.  
The project focuses on understanding the core concepts of SignalR, especially the usage of **Hub** methods and client-server communication.

## 📌 What This Project Includes

- Implementation of a custom `Hub` class  
- Server-side method definitions for broadcasting messages  
- Client-side JavaScript to connect to the Hub and call server methods  
- Simple visualization in HTML to test and demonstrate the communication

## 🧠 Focus Areas

- Understanding how SignalR Hubs work
- How clients connect and communicate with the server
- Invoking server methods from the client and vice versa
- Basic front-end integration for testing (not a full chat app)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core  
- SignalR  
- JavaScript (jQuery)  
- HTML, Bootstrap

## 📚 Purpose

This is a learning project to understand the basics of SignalR and client-server communication via Hub methods.  
No advanced chat logic or database integration is implemented.
